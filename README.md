# Wikipydia
A coroutine-based, asynchronous Wikipedia API wrapper for Python.  
Powered by [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html "asyncio").  

## Why?
Wikipedia bots and automation tools.  

## Who made this?
Me, ry00001, at the moment. More developers may be brought in if the project gets big/important enough.
